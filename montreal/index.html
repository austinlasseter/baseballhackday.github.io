    <h2>Come join us!</h2>
    <article>
      <p>
        Join us for the second annual Montreal Baseball Hack Day on March 19th, 2016. Held at the Breather space in the Belgo Building, the Montreal Baseball Hack Day will be joining Boston, Philadelphia, and Chicago in hosting this one day event to encourage the development of Baseball related projects, partnerships and experiments with the goal of creating better ties between our technology and sports communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of the day is to bring creative minds into one room and see what they can produce within a limited time. The project could be (but is not limited to) a tool, simple web app, mobile app, website, or data visualization. With a data set that extends back almost 150 years, there is no better sport to challenge the development of unique technical & design focused internet projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Designers, developers, statisticians, and baseball enthusiasts alike are welcome! We are also looking for sponsors to help offset the costs of hosting our inaugural event and judges to evaluate the projects and then present the winning team with a grand prize. There is no cost to attend and participate in the event, but there are limited spots available, so we encourage you to book early.
      </p>
      <p>
        The full day event will include breakfast, lunch and a bevy of snacks throughout the day. We will end with an award ceremony to present the winning project.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to see some examples of projects that were presented last year in Boston or Philadelphia for inspiration, <a href="http://2015baseballhackday.devpost.com/submissions">click here to see the list of winning projects.</a>

    <h2>Three Tracks in Montreal</h2>
    <article>
      <p>To encourage participation of developers and designers of all levels, there will be <strong>three tracks</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First, <strong>"hacking track"</strong> is our usual, typical Baseball Hack Day track. You come with project and recruit people, or come and find a project to join and work on it for the day.</li>
        <li>Second one is a <strong>"project track"</strong>, where we have project/challenge ready to be worked on. There will be a "project manager" or "leader" type person to lead the team(s) to solve the challenge.</li>
        <li>Third one is a <strong>learning track</strong>, which is mostly designed for first-time hackathon attendees. This is where you can learn how to hack from Baseball Hack Day's mentor volunteers. Less like competition and more like a workshop.</li>
      </ul>
