    <h2>Come join us on March 17th!</h2>
    <article>
    <p>Love creating stuff on your computer and LOVE baseball? Come hack with us on March 17 at mHub,&nbsp;965 West Chicago Avenue.</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.baseballhackday.com/" target="_blank">Baseball Hack Day</a>&nbsp;is an annual on-site, in-person hacking event where area baseball fans come together and create baseball-related projects to compete in a fun, friendly, one-day competition.</p>
    <p>Born in Boston spring of 2012, Baseball Hack Day is a grass-roots, open-sourced movement, held at the same day at different locations all around the world. The goal of the day is to bring creative tech minds into one room, and see what they can produce within a limited time. The project could be (but is not limited to) a tool, simple web app, mobile app, web site, data visualization, or a video.</p>
    <p>This event is based on the principal of the original&nbsp;<a href="http://hackdaymanifesto.com/" target="_blank">the Hack Day Manifesto</a>&nbsp;and will always be free to attend, thanks to our generous sponsors. We are run by volunteers, pro bono, labor for love, and we&rsquo;ll never be for-profit. We follow&nbsp;<a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html" target="_blank">contributor-covenant-style code of conduct</a>.</p>
    <p>New to hack days? Have no fear. This is a hackathon of developers and designers of all levels. See past submissions to get an idea. See our resources in&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/baseballhackday/data-and-resources/wiki/Resources-and-ideas" target="_blank">github wiki</a>, check out&nbsp;<a href="http://baseballhackday.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">our inspiraton blog on tumblr</a>, and follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/baseballhackchi" target="_blank">Twitter @BaseballHackChi</a>.<br /></p>
