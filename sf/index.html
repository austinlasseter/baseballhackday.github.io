      <p>The fifth annual Baseball Hack Day is a fun, friendly one-day hacking competition (also known as hackathon, hackfest or codefest) for baseball fans.</p>

      <p>It is the day where area baseball minds come together and see what cool projects can be created within a limited time. The project could be (but is not limited to) a tool, app, website, or data visualization. Baseball Hack Day is a free event thanks to our generous sponsors. The event is based on the principal of <a href="http://hackdaymanifesto.com/">the Hack Day Manifesto</a>.</p>
