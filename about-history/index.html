    <article>
      <p>Love creating stuff on your computer and LOVE baseball? Come hack with us!</p>
      <p>The annual Baseball Hack Day is a fun, friendly one-day hacking competition for baseball fans. It is spreading around the world, and if you'd like to start your own chapter, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bwzyhGPWIfZ6w5FyQqUOpu_s8vkUwcrPy2UHvw4QImY/edit?usp=sharing">Read this google document.</a></p>
      <p>It is the day where area baseball minds come together and see what cool projects can be created within a limited time. The project could be (but is not limited to) a tool, app, website, or data visualization. Baseball Hack Day is a free event thanks to our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N1UtvOCPPPdMF-Y7zvwGZOL5cObL9a2Z0ouOUB5JCTA/edit?usp=sharing">generous sponsors</a> and volunteers.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <article>     
      <p>Baseball Hack Day was orginally born out of a Boston area news &amp; geek meetup group <a href="http://meetupbos.hackshackers.com/">Hacks/Hackers</a> and <a href="http://chapters.sabr.org/boston/">Society of American Baseball Research Boston Chapter</a> after watching terrible collapse of 2011 Red Sox season. Our <a href="/2012/">first event was held at The Boston Globe on March 24, 2012</a> with 35 participants with 9 projects. In 2013, <a href="/2013/">thoughtbot hosted a 31-participants, 10-projects fun and inspiring hack day</a> in March. In 2014, Baseball Hack day <a href="/2014/">expanded into two cities, Boston and Philadelphia</a>. You can see submissions and winners of the past years: <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/boston-baseball-hack-day-2013/hacks">2013</a> and <a href="http://baseballhackday.challengepost.com/submissions">2014</a>. In 2015, we are expanding to Chicago, and San Francisco!</p>
      <p>The event is based on the principal of <a href="http://hackdaymanifesto.com/">the Hack Day Manifesto</a>. It will always be free to attend, and we are run by volunteers, and we&rsquo;ll never be for-profit (It's a labor of love).</p>
