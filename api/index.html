            <h3>The Sports Data Platform you've always wanted</h3>
              <p>Easy to remember, friendly slugs like "nfl-tom-brady" and "passes-touchdowns".</p>

              <p>Consistent patterns means that a call to get touchdowns looks like the endpoint to get free throws, home runs, or power-play goals.</p>

              <p>Use natural language dates like "last sunday" or "1 week ago" to query stats.</p>

              <p>But most of all, you shouldn't need to spend hours writing custom code for each sport, league or set of stats you want to visualize, analyze, or present.</p>

            <h3>Affordable. Meaningful. Developer-Friendly.</h3>

            <p>Sure, we can just give you raw data. But data should be fun and purposeful.</p>

            <p>We've categorized and quantified player and teams performances into feats that can quickly be compared, contrasted and put into context.</p>

            <p>Instantly know if a stat is a commonplace occurrence or a record-tying achievement.</p>
